```
Type in the name of a painter. So far, the model supports:

## Conditional Variational Autoencoder
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) learn a regularized distributions of the training data during training. Regularization ensures thtat the latent space has good properties (i.e., most commonly, is a normal distribution). The model is able to reconstruct images (see Reconstruction by VAE) by passing into the encoder and the decoder but generate new data as well. This is done by sampling from the latent space and passing it to the generator.

Conditional VAE is an extension of VAE which enables us to specify the type of samples that should be generated. In this case, it corresponds to the name of the author. 

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). Images were resized to 64x64.
There are over 8500 images with the most common genres being Impressionism (1647), Post-Impressionism (1048), Symbolims (666), and Surrealism (435).
And there are over 50 artists, such as Vincent van Gogh, Edgar Degas, Albrecht Durer, Pablo Picasso, and Salvador Dali.
